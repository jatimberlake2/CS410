# CS410
The assignments for CS 410 : Introduction to Databases, primarily using PostgreSQL

The assignments' names for this class were not consistent, but I tried to keep my naming paradigm consistent.

The majority of the testing for the SQL codes was done on a school server and access to my tables and saved queries can only be accessed through there for testing.

The final project also has the majority of the source code needed to replicate the database. However, the provided E/R diagram was made incorrectly, using queries as relations instead of tables.

All of my completed homework assignments end in my blazer ID, "justony7".
